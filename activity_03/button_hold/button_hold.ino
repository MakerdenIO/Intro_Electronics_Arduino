  Description: 
  We set up a push button and LED so that when the button is pushed the
  LED tuns on for as long as the button remains depressed.

// Initialize variable that will hold the push button state

  // Initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(led_pin, OUTPUT);
  // Initialize the pushbutton pin as an input that is internally pulled up
  // to 5V using the built-in 20~50K resistors (ATmega328p on the Arduino Uno)
  pinMode(button_pin, INPUT_PULLUP);  
}

void loop()
{
  // Read the state of the pushbutton value:
  button_state = digitalRead(button_pin); // pulled up to 5V by default 
  
  // Check if the push button is pressed. If it is, the button state is 
  // LOW because the button is connected to ground:
  if (button_state == LOW) 
  {
    // Turn LED on:    
    digitalWrite(led_pin, HIGH);  
  }
  // otherwise (i.e., if button_state is HIGH)
  else 
  {
    // Turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(led_pin, LOW); 
  }
