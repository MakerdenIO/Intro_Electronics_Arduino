  Description:
  We make use of one of the simplest digital sensors, a tilt detector. 
  This sensor behaves like a push button and creates a closed (short) or 
  open circuit between its 2 pins depending on the physical inclination of
  the sensor relative to the earth's gravitational field vector.
  
  We take the opportunity to introduce the concept of interrupts, and
  explore the microcontroller's low-power (sleep) modes.
